# Project Challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to help you enhance your coding skills by creating various projects. These projects include a range of difficulty levels and incorporate different components that can be used in mobile or web applications.

The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate that by using pure Vanilla JavaScript, you can build anything without the need for any frameworks, and you can learn JavaScript in-depth. 

This repository offers a variety of project ideas, but you are welcome to propose new projects by creating an issue for each one.

Enjoy the challenge and have fun! ðŸ˜‡
